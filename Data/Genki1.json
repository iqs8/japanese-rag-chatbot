  "text": "\"I am a student.\" \"My major is the Japanese language.\" \"It is 12:30\". These sentences will all be translated \r\ninto Japanese using an appropriate noun and the word desu.\r\n\r\n**〜です。     It is...**\r\n\r\nがくせいです。= (I) am a student.\r\nGakusee desu.\r\n\r\nにほんごです。= (My major) is the Japanese language.\r\nNihongo desu.\r\n\r\nじゅうにはんです。= (It) is half past twelve.\r\nJuunji han desu.\r\n\r\nNote that none of these sentences has a \"subject,\" like the \"I,\" \"my major,\" and \"it\" found in their English \r\ncounterparts. Sentences without subjects are very common in Japanese; Japanese speakers actually tend to omit \r\nsubjects whenever they think it is clear to the listener what or who they are referring to.\r\n\r\nIf it is not clear from the background situation or the preceding context what is being talked about, you can\r\n start a sentence with a \"topic\" marked by wa. Note that when we write in hiragana, we use the letter は for \r\n topic wa following the classical orthography.¹\r\n\r\n**XはYです。     X is Y. As for X, it is Y.**\r\n\r\nせんこうは にほんごです。= (My) major is the Japanese language.\r\nSenkou wa nihongo desu.\r\n\r\nわたしは ソラ・キムです。= I am Sora Kim.\r\nWatashi wa Sora Kimu desu.\r\n\r\nやましたさんは せんせいです。=  Mr. Yamashita is a teacher.\r\nYamashita san wa sensee desu.\r\n\r\nメアリーさんは アメリカじんです。= Mary is an American.\r\nMearii san wa amerikajin desu.\r\n\r\n¹ The hiragana は therefore has two pronunciations: wa (in the topic position) and ha (in most other positions). \r\nThere are few exceptions, such as konnichiwa (good afternoon) and konbanwa (good evening). They are usually \r\nwritten with こんにちは and こんばんは.\r\n\r\nWa is a member of the class of words called \"particles.\" So is the word no, which we will turn to later in this lesson. \r\nWe add particles to noun phrases to indicate how the phrases relate to the rest of the sentence.\r\n\r\nNote also that nouns like gakusee and sensee in the above examples stand alone, unlike their English translations \r\n\"student\" and \"teacher,\" which are preceded by \"a.\" In Japanese, there is no item that corresponds to \"a,\" nor is \r\nthere any item that corresponds to the plural \"-s\" at the end of a noun. Without context, a sentence like \r\ngakusee desu is therefore ambiguous in terms of the singular and plural interpretations.\r\n"

Question sentences may also contain a \r\n\"question word\" like nan³ (what). In this lesson, we learn how to ask, and answer, questions using the following \r\nquestion words: nanji (what time), nansai (how old), nannensee (what year in school), and nanban (what number).\r\n\r\nA: せんこうは なんですか。\r\nB: （せんこうは）えいごです。\r\nSenkou wa nan desu ka.\r\n(Senkou wa) eego desu.\r\nA: What is your major?\r\nB: (My major) is English.\r\n\r\nA: いま なんじですか。\r\nB: （いま）くじです。\r\nIma nanji desu ka.\r\n(Ima) kuji desu.\r\nA: What time is it now?\r\nB: It is nine o\"clock.\r\n\r\nA: メアリーさんは なんさいですか。\r\nB: じゅうきゅうさいです。\r\nMearii san wa nansai desu ka.\r\nJuukyuusai desu.\r\nA: How old are you, Mary?\r\nB: I’m nineteen years old.\r\n\r\nA: なんねんせいですか。\r\nB: にねんせいです。\r\nNannensee desu ka.\r\nNinensee desu.\r\nA: What year are you in college?\r\nB: I’m a sophomore.\r\n\r\n² It is not customary to write a question mark at the end of a question sentence in Japanese.\r\n³ The Japanese question word for \"what\" has two pronunciations: nan and nani. Nan is used immediately \r\nbefore desu or before a \"counter\" like ji (o\"clock). The other form, nani, is used before a particle. \r\nNani is also used in the combination nanjin (person of what nationality).\r\n\r\nA: でんわばんごうは なんばんですか。\r\nB: 867-5309です。\r\nDenwa bangou wa nanban desu ka.\r\nHachi roku nana go san zero kyuu desu.\r\nA: What is your telephone number?\r\nB: It is 867-5309."

  "topic": "Verb Conjugation",
  "chunk_id": 11,
  "text": "\nIn this lesson, we learn about the dictionary forms¹, the present tense affirmative forms, and the present \ntense negative forms.\n\nThree Groups of Verbs\n\nWe sort Japanese verbs into three groups based on their conjugation: ru-verbs, u-verbs, and irregular verbs.\n\n(1) Ru-verbs\n\nRu-verbs are made up of a base which ends with either e or i plus the suffix ru. All ru-verbs, therefore, \nend with eru or iru. (So, if you see a verb that ends with aru, oru, or uru, you can be sure that they are \nnot ru-verbs.²)\n\n食べる (tabe + ru)    寝る (ne + ru)    起きる (oki + ru)    見る (mi + ru)\n\n(2) U-verbs\n\nU-verbs are made up of a consonant-final base plus u (e.g., 飲む nom + u). Note that 帰る ends with an eru \nsequence but is not a ru-verb as defined above. The r sound in 帰る comes from the base and not from the suffix.\n\n飲む (nom + u)    読む (yom + u)    話す (hanas + u)\n聞く (kik + u)    行く (ik + u)     帰る (kaer + u)\n\n#### (3) Irregular verbs³\n\nThere are two \"irregular verbs,\" する and くる. する is a very productive element. \n勉強する is an example of a complex verb formed by a noun and する.\n\nする (suru)    勉強する (benkyoosuru)    くる (kuru)\n\n---\n\n### Present Tense Conjugation\n\nLet's now turn to the present tense conjugation. With ru-verbs, you simply replace ru with masu \n(affirmative) or masen (negative).\n\n#### Ru-verbs\n| Dictionary form | Present, affirmative | Present, negative |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| 食べる          | 食べます            | 食べません        |\n| 寝る            | 寝ます              | 寝ません          |\n| 起きる          | 起きます            | 起きません        |\n| 見る            | 見ます              | 見ません          |\n\nWith u-verbs, you replace u with imasu and imasen. You can think of the change as going up and down in the same hiragana column (shifting between み and む in the column まみむめも, for example).\n\n#### U-verbs\n| Dictionary form | Present, affirmative | Present, negative |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| 飲む            | 飲みます            | 飲みません        |\n| 読む            | 読みます            | 読みません        |\n| 話す            | 話します            | 話しません        |\n| 聞く            | 聞きます            | 聞きません        |\n| 行く            | 行きます            | 行きません        |\n\n帰る is an u-verb, and the verb base final consonant r is kept in the present tense conjugation. \nSo, instead of × 帰ます, we have:\n\nDictionary form: 帰る\nPresent, affirmative: 帰ります\nPresent, negative: 帰りません\n\nWith irregular verbs, the conjugation looks like the following.\n\nIrregular verbs\n| Dictionary form | Present, affirmative | Present, negative |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| する            | します              | しません          |\n| 勉強する        | 勉強します          | 勉強しません      |\n| くる            | きます              | きません          |\n\n---\n\nMake sure you remember which verb belongs to which conjugation class. It is a good idea, therefore, \nto memorize each verb as a set: instead of memorizing just the dictionary form, try to memorize the \ndictionary form and the present tense affirmative, like 行く→行きます.\n\nTo recap the rules for telling which verb that ends with hiragana る belongs to which class, \nwe note that if a verb ends with\n\n• aru or oru, it is definitely an u-verb\n• uru, it can either be an irregular verb or an u-verb\n• iru or eru, it is more likely to be a ru-verb, but it can also be an u-verb.\n"

  "text": "\nAs we saw in Lesson 1, the particle は presents the topic of one's utterance (\"As for item X, it is such that...\"). \nIt puts forward the item that you want to talk about. You may have noted that the topic phrases in sentences such \nas メアリーさんは二年生です (Mary is a sophomore), and 私の専攻は日本語です (My major is the Japanese language), are \nthe subjects of those sentences. A topic phrase, however, need not be the subject of a sentence. We see three sentences \nin the dialogue of this lesson where nonsubject phrases are made topics with the help of the particle は.\n\nメアリーさん、週末はたいてい何をしますか。  \nメアリー さん、しゅうまつ は たいてい なに を しますか。  \n*Mary, what do you usually do on the weekend?*\n\n今日は京都に行きます。  \nきょう は きょうと に いきます。  \n*I'm going to Kyoto today.*\n\nIn the above two examples, は presents time expressions as the topic of each sentence. \nIts effects can be paraphrased like these: \"Let's talk about weekends; what do you do on weekends?\" \"Let me say what \nI will do today; I will go to Kyoto.\"\n\nA：晩ご飯は？  \nA：ばんごはん は？  \n*How about dinner?*\n\nB：食べません。  \nB：たべません。  \n*I will not eat.*\n\nIn this example, は is used in directing the listener's attention and thereby inviting a comment or \ncompletion of a sentence. You may also note that the broached topic, 晩ご飯, does not stand in subject \nrelation to the verb, but is rather its direct object.\n\n"

The two types of \nadjectives follow different conjugation patterns.\n\nYou just add です to both い-adjectives and な-adjectives for affirmative present tense sentences. In negative \nsentences, you replace the last い of an い-adjective with くない. な-adjectives are just like nouns and you only\n need to change です to じゃないです.\n\n### [Present]\n\n**い-adjectives**\n- e.g. さむい\n\n**Affirmative:** さむいです  \n*It is cold.*\n\n**Negative:** さむくないです  \n(or さむくありません)  \n*It is not cold.*\n\n**な-adjectives**\n- e.g. 元気（な）\n\n**Affirmative:** 元気です  \n*She is healthy.*\n\n**Negative:** 元気じゃないです  \n(or 元気じゃありません)  \n*She is not healthy.*\n\n**Example Dialogue:**\n- A：その本はおもしろいですか。 *Is that book interesting?*\n- B：いいえ、あまりおもしろくないです。 *No, it is not very interesting.*\n- A：今日、ひまですか。 *Are you free today?*\n- B：いいえ、ひまじゃないです。 *No, I'm not.*\n\nWith both い- and な-adjectives, you find two negative forms: ないです and ありません. The ないです pattern is more\ncolloquial, and ありません is more conservative and more appropriate in the written language. Just like negation \nwith nouns (see Lesson 2), じゃ in the negative version can also be replaced with では in more formal situations. \nDon't apply the noun/な-adjective pattern to い-adjectives. It is wrong to say ×さむいじゃないです, for example.\n\nUnlike verbs, adjectives conjugate fairly uniformly. The only irregularity worth noticing at this stage is the \nbehavior of the adjective いい (good). The first syllable of いい is changed to よ in all forms except the dictionary\n form.¹ Compound adjectives like かっこいい that are built with いい follow this syllable change² and we say \n かっこよくないです.\n\n### [Present] (irregular)\n\n**いい**\n\n**Affirmative:** いいです  \n**Negative:** よくないです  \n(or よくありません)\n\nIf you want to say things like \"very hot,\" and \"a little hot,\" you can add \"degree adverbs\" like とても \n(extremely), とても (very) and ちょっと (a little; slightly) before adjectives.\n\n- 沖縄の海はとてもきれいです。 *The sea is very beautiful in Okinawa.*\n- この部屋はちょっと暑いです。 *This room is a little hot.*\n\n¹ There actually are alternative forms, よい and よいです, but they are much less frequently used than いい \nand いいです in the spoken language.\n\n² Despite its appearance when it is written in hiragana, かわいい (cute), which we will learn in Lesson 7, is \nnot made up of いい, and therefore does not go through this い to よ change, and we say かわいくないです.\n"

Be careful not to come up with improper forms such \nas ×会いて (compare 会います) and ×読みて (compare 読みます) in u-verbs. You may want to memorize each verb as a set, \nas in 書く—書きます—書いて.

In the second example, the te-form describes the situation for which the \napology is made.\n\nバスに乗って、会社に行きます。  \n*I go to work by bus. (I take a bus to work.)*\n\n教科書を忘れて、すみません。  \n*I am sorry for not bringing in the textbook. (I left the book at home, and I am sorry.)*\n"

  "chunk_id": 40,
  "text": "\nIn this lesson, we will learn to use verb te-forms together with the helping verb いる. To understand what such \na sentence means, we will need to understand the semantics of Japanese verbs. Japanese verbs can be classified \ninto the following three types.\n\n(1) verbs that describe *activities* that last for some time (e.g., 食べる, 読む)\n(2) verbs that describe *changes* that are more or less instantaneous (e.g., 死ぬ, 起きる)¹\n(3) verbs that describe continuous *states* (e.g., ある, いる)\n\nYou can use verbs in the first group, such as 食べる and 読む, in their te-form with the helping verb いる to \ndescribe *actions in progress*.² We will discuss the verbs of the second type in the following section. The \nthird type which describes states does not go with ている.\n\n**Activity verbs ている = action in progress**\n\nソラさんは今勉強しています。*Sora is studying right now.*\n\nたけしさんは英語の本を読んでいます。*Takeshi is reading a book in English.*\n\n今、何をしていますか。*What are you doing right now?*\n\nYou can also use a 〜ています sentence to describe what a person does by occupation or by habit. The first \nexample below therefore has two possible interpretations: you are actually teaching English right at this \nmoment, or you are an English-language teacher (but are not necessarily in class right now.) The second \nexample means that Mary is in the habit of studying Japanese (but of course she does not spend 24 hours a \nday doing so).\n\n---\n\n¹ Among the verbs we have learned so far, verbs such as 起きる, 行く, 帰る, 来る, わかる, 出かける, 借りる, \n降りる, 持ってくる, 連れてくる, 結婚する, 泳ぐ, やせる, 着る are change verbs. In most cases you can determine \nwhether a verb is in the activity class or a change class by checking if the verb allows for a phrase describing \nduration, such as 一時間. Compare, for example,\n○私はその一時間本を読みました。*I read a book for an hour yesterday.*\n×私は一時間死にました。*(Ungrammatical, much as the English translation \"I died for an hour,\" which is also odd.)*\n読む thus is an activity verb and 死ぬ is a change verb.\n\n² The distinction between いる and ある that we learned in Lesson 4 does not apply to this helping verb 〜ている: \nyou can use 〜ている both for living things and for inanimate objects.\n\n私は英語を教えています。\n*I teach English. / I am teaching English (right now).*\n\nメアリーさんは毎日日本語を勉強しています。\n*Mary studies Japanese every day.*\n\nThe helping verb いる conjugates as a ru-verb. Thus we have long forms as in the following.\n\n**e.g. 食べている**\n\n|  | affirmative | negative |\n|---|---|---|\n| [Present] | 食べています | 食べていません |\n|  | *He is eating.* | *He is not eating.* |\n| [Past] | 食べていました | 食べていませんでした |\n|  | *He was eating.* | *He was not eating.* |\n"

Thus 行っている and 来ている indicate the \nresult of prior movements, *not* movements that are currently in progress. You may want to be careful \nwith what the following sentences mean.\n\n中国に行っています。*Somebody has gone to/is in China.* (Not: *She is going to China.*)\n\nうちに来ています。*Somebody has come over to visit.* (Not: *Somebody is coming over.*)\n\nYou can simply use the present tense and say メアリーさんは来ます, for example, if you want to say Mary is \ncoming, because the present tense in Japanese refers both to the present and to the future.\n\n⁵ The negation of 知っています is 知りません, without the ている formation.\n"

They include \"plain forms,\" \"informal forms,\" and \n\"direct style.\" Long forms, on the other hand, are often called \"polite forms,\" \"formal forms,\" and \"distal style.\"\n\nThink of the u-verb conjugation as moving up and down in the hiragana chart. Let's take 書く for example. \nThe dictionary form 書く is the combination of the verb base in the kanji 書 and the bottom hiragana of that row. く. \n書きます is the combination of 書, き, and the ます ending on the right. 書かない is 書, か², and ない.\n\n+-------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\n| Form                    | 書   | 話   | 待   | 死   | 読   | 作   | 泳   | 呼   | 買   |\n+-------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\n| Negative (~ない)         | か   | さ   | た   | な   | ま   | ら   | が   | ば   | わ   |\n| Stem (~ます)             | き   | し   | ち   | に   | み   | り   | ぎ   | び   | い   |\n| Affirmative (dictionary) | く   | す   | つ   | ぬ   | む   | る   | ぐ   | ぶ   | う   |\n+-------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\n\n² Note that we have 買わない, with わ instead of あ, because the bases of u-verbs ending with the hiragana う actually \nend with the consonant w, which remains silent in 買う and 買います, but resurfaces in 買わない.\n"

First of all, Japanese speakers are \noften very conscious of seniority. A year's difference in age may in many cases totally preclude the possibility of \nestablishing a truly \"equal\" relationship. Second, license to use short forms is not mutual; senior partners may feel \nperfectly justified in using short forms while expecting their junior partners to continue addressing them with long \nforms. Thus, if somebody who is older, say, your Japanese language professor, talks to you using short forms, they \nwould be greatly surprised if you were to do the same.\n\nProfessor: この漢字、わかる？³        Do you know this kanji?\nStudent:   はい、わかります。          Yes, I do.\n(×うん、わかる。)\n(Long form preferred, because you are talking to somebody who is older.)\n\nIn the casual conversations, you drop the question particle か, and use the rising intonation to ask a question.⁴\n\nどんな音楽を聞く？      (×どんな音楽を聞くか？)\nWhat kind of music do you listen to?\n\nAlso, in the spoken language, you usually drop the sentence-final だ after a な-adjective or a noun. \n(You keep the last だ in the written language, however.)\nA：元気？                Are you good?\nB：うん、元気。          Yes, I am.\n(Rather than: 元気だ。)\n\nYou keep だ when you follow it up with ね or よ.\n\nメアリーさんは二年生だよ。        Mary is a sophomore.\n(Rather than: メアリーさんは二年生だ。)\n\nはい and いいえ are usually replaced by the less formal うん and ううん.\n\nA：よくスポーツをする？          Do you often play sports?\nB：うん、する。／ううん、しない。  Yes, I do. / No, I don't.\n\n³ Particles are more often dropped in casual speech than in careful, polite speech or writing.\n⁴ We usually write the question mark at the end of such a sentence, because we cannot rely on the intonation.\n"

  "text": "\nHere we will learn the past tense paradigm of short forms. With four parts of speech and two polarities, \nthere are eight forms in the chart, \nbut you need to learn only three rules.\n\n(1) Verbs: Replace the te-form endings て and で with た and だ.\n(2) い-adjectives: Replace the last い with かった. You may also think of this in terms of \"dropping てす\" \nfrom the long form.\n(3) な-adjectives and nouns: Replace the long form でした ending with だった.\nNegation: ない conjugates as an い-adjective. Therefore, for all categories, you can replace the last ない \nwith なかった.\n\n### Past, affirmative\n- verbs: 食べた / 食べて, 読んだ / 読んで\n- い-adjectives: かわいかった / かわいい・かわいかったです\n- な-adjectives: 静かだった / 静かでした\n- noun + です: 学生だった / 学生でした\n\n### Past, negative\n- verbs: 読まなかった / 読まない\n- い-adjectives: かわいくなかった / かわいくない\n- な-adjectives: 静かじゃなかった / 静かじゃない\n- noun + です: 学生じゃなかった / 学生じゃない\n"

Don't rely on the word order, \ntherefore, to decide which item is claimed to be superior. Listen carefully for the words のほう が and より.\n\n² In place of どちらのほう and どっちのほう, you can also use どちら and どっち.

You can say:\n\nバスが来なかったんです。 (As it happens,) the bus didn't come.\n\nAn explanation therefore connects a fact (the bus not coming), to another element in the situation under \ndiscussion (you being late for the appointment). The sentence-final expression んです serves as the link \nbetween what the sentence says and what it accounts for. Compare:\n\nあしたテストがあります。 I have an exam tomorrow. (a simple observation)\nあしたテストがあるんです。 I have an exam tomorrow. (So I can't go out tonight.)\n\nトイレに行きたいです。 I want to go to the bathroom. (declaration of one's wish)\nトイレに行きたいんです。 I want to go to the bathroom. (So tell me where it is.)\n\nんです itself is invariant and does not usually appear in the negative or the past tense forms,¹ but the \npredicate before it can be affirmative or negative, present tense or past tense.\n\n成績がよくないんです。 (in response to the question \"Why do you look so upset?\")\n(As a matter of fact) My grade is not good.\n\n試験が終わったんです。 (explaining to a person who has caught you smiling)\nThe exam is over. (That's why I'm smiling.)\n\n¹ In casual exchanges, んです appears in its short form, んだ.

It is very \noften used together with question words, such as どうして (why) and どうした (what has happened).\n\nA：どうして彼と別れたんですか。\nWhy did you break up with your boyfriend? (You've got to tell me.)\nB：彼、ぜんぜんお風呂に入らないんです。\nOh, him. He never takes a bath. (That's a good enough reason, isn't it?)\n\nA：どうしたんですか。\nWhat happened?

(That should explain how I look today.)\n\nYou can also use んです to provide an additional comment on what has just been said.\n\nA：かわいいノートですね。\nThat's a cute notebook.\nB：ええ、日本で買ったんです。\nYou bet. I bought it in Japan (for your information).\n\nIn the written language, you see のです instead of んです. It has the same functions but is stylistically more formal.\n\n² A どうしたんですか question is best answered by a んです sentence with the subject marked with the particle \nが rather than は, as in this example.

Use modifiers like とても and \nすごく if you simply want to say that something is in a high degree.\n\n³ In addition to the verb conjugation, we also use the noun すぎ, as in 食べすぎです.\n"

  "text": "\nほうがいいです \"it is better (for you) to do...\" is a sentence-final expression which you can use to\n give advice. ほうがいいです follows a verb in the short form. You usually use the past tense of a verb with \n ほうがいいです if the verb is in the affirmative. When the advice is in the negative, however, the verb is in \n the present tense.\n\n**verb (short, past, affirmative)  } + ほうがいいです     It is better.**  \n**verb (short, present, negative)  }                      It is better not...**\n\nもっと野菜を食べたほうがいいですよ。  \n*You'd better eat more vegetables.*\n\n授業を休まないほうがいいですよ。  \n*It is better not to skip classes.*\n"
